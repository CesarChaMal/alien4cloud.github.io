This section is incomplete and we suggest you to refer to the roadmap section in order to have a preview on the planned features for 1.2.0 version.

# TOSCA Support

Alien 4 Cloud now supports TOSCA Simple Profile

The previous supported dsl version is now deprecated.

We also support the alien_dsl in the enterprise version. It is a subset of the TOSCA 1.0 dsl that allows the definition of some additional information like portability data.
