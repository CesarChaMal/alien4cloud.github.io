Let us introduce you to concepts in Alien 4 Cloud. Alien 4 Cloud is an application that allows people in the enterprise to collaborate in order to provide self-service deployment of complex applications taking in account the different experts through a r√¥le based portal.

Alien 4 Cloud want to provide self-service no only for users but also for development teams that want to build and deploy complex applications and leverage cloud resources to deploy their environments in minutes.

In order to provide enterprise self-service portal, alien 4 cloud leverages the following concept:

* __Location__: Deployment target (cloud or set of physical machines)
* __Components__: Software components to deploy
* __Topologies__ (or blueprints): Description of multiple software components assembled together (to build an application).
* __Applications__: Actual applications to deploy with _environments_ and _versions_ each of them being associated with a topology.
* __TOSCA__: An emerging standard to describe service components and their relationships

On top of these notions Alien 4 Cloud provide a comprehensive set of __roles__ that can be mapped in flexible manners to the people and structure of an enterprise IT department.
