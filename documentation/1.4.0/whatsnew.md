# On-demand custom location resource templates

Custom on demand resources can now be defined as location resource templates, directly in the on-demand tab of the location view. (For more info, see [the documentation](#/documentation/1.4.0/user_guide/orchestrator_location_management.html))

Having created such a template, this means that it is now possible to match abstract nodes to custom resources in a topology, allowing for more flexibility and reusability.
