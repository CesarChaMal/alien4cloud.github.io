## How to upload your components archives in **ALIEN**

You cannot upload the same archive (same id and version) mutliple times. If you changed an archive, you must increment the version number so you can upload it to **ALIEN**.

There are two ways to upload components descriptions in **ALIEN** regarding you browser capabilities :

### Drag&Drop *disabled*

> Click on *[Upload CSAR]* > *Select* your archive (The file is automaticly uploaded)
