TOSCA normative lifecycle is automatically generated by the TOSCA container based on the normative node and relationship types.

{% note %}
Note that the TOSCA specification on lifecycle is still being written so this may be subject to changes before v1 release.
{% endnote %}

Lifecycle is based on the normative node interface (tosca.interfaces.node.lifecycle.Standard) and relationship interface (tosca.interfaces.relationship.Configure).

## Node Lifecycle generation

1. call the node's _create_ operation
2. wait for all node that is a _DependsOn_ target (current node being source of the relationship) to reach the _started_ state.
3. wait for all node that is a _ConnectsTo_ source (current node being target of the relationship) to reach the _created_ state.
4. call the relationships _pre_configure_source_ (if the node is the relationship source) or _pre_configure_target_ (if the node is the relationship target)
5. call the node's _configure_ operation
6. call the relationships _post_configure_source_ (if the node is the relationship source) or _post_configure_target_ (if the node is the relationship target)
7.
