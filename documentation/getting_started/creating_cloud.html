<p>In Alien 4 Cloud every deployment is done on what we call a <em>Cloud</em>. Clouds in A4C can represent a real cloud or more often a separated logically deployment entity.</p>

<p>For example a cloud can refer to an Amazon configuration using a specific account while another cloud could be configured to work on a specific Tenant on an OpenStack cloud.</p>

<p>Using some PaaS Providers like Cloudify 2 you can even configure a set of running machines (that doesn’t have to be VMs) to create a logical set of available resources that Alien 4 Cloud can use to deploy applications.</p>

<div class="note info">
<p>You can create and configure as many clouds as you like to have as many deployment environment as required.</p>
</div>

<h1 id="paas-providers-and-plugins">PaaS Providers and plugins</h1>

<p>Alien 4 Cloud is not managing actual runtime state of deployments by itself. In order to do so it delegates runtime to what we call PaaS Providers. A PaaS Provider in A4C is a plugin that is associated with a <em>cloud</em> configured in A4C. Every cloud may use the same PaaS Provider or may use different PaaS Providers.</p>

<p>Anyway in order to create clouds (that are required to perform deployments) you have to first upload a PaaS provider plugin (Alien 4 Cloud supports other type of plugins as well but we won’t detail this here).</p>

<p>The current recommended plugin to start is leveraging Cloudify as the PaaS Orchestrator tool. Cloudify is OpenSource just like A4C and fits very well with it. We are currently using the version Cloudify 2.7. We will move to Cloudify 3.1 once released as GigaSpaces plan to support TOSCA as an input in cloudify 3.1.</p>

<h2 id="installing-cloudify-27-plugin">Installing Cloudify 2.7 plugin</h2>

<p>Follow <a href="../cloudify2_driver/index.html">this link</a> in order to find more on installation and configuration of your coud environment using cloudify 2.</p>

<h2 id="using-mock-plugin">Using mock plugin</h2>

<p>If you want to try out Alien 4 Cloud but not use a real cloud for deployments you can use the mock PaaS Provider plugin. This is a plugin that we use for our tests and that mock the PaaS orchestrator.</p>

<div class="note warning">
<p>The mock plugin does not allow you to test any of your components as it do not deploy anything or even call your scripts. To do so you should use a real PaaS Provider plugin like cloudify plugin and deploy on a local cloud technology like Virtua Box or Docker (note that docker support will come with support of cloudify 3).</p>
</div>

<h1 id="create-a-cloud">Create a cloud</h1>

<p>Once you have installed a plugin the admin can go on the cloud page and configure cloud. Remember that you can use the Alien 4 Cloud contextual help in order to be guided directly within the application.</p>

<h1 id="manage-cloud-resources">Manage cloud resources</h1>

<p>Once created you must configure the cloud. Configuring a cloud requires several step:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Configure the properties of the PaaS provider (that depends of the choosen one).</li>
  <li>Configure cloud resources (images and flavors) used for resources matchin at deployment time.</li>
</ul>
