This guide will explain how to take in charge Alien in details and configure it for your uses.

##1. Prerequisites:

* Ensure that you have at least JAVA version 7 or higher installed on your working station. If not, just install
java following instructions [here](https://www.java.com/fr/download/manual.jsp){:target="_blank"}.

* You can get *Cloudify* in version 3.3 [here](http://getcloudify.org/downloads/get_cloudify_3x.html#dl){:target="_blank"}.

* In order to start using alien 4 cloud you have to download Alien: [alien4cloud-dist](http://fastconnect.org/maven/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=opensource&g=alien4cloud&a=alien4cloud-dist&v=1.1.0&p=tar.gz&c=dist)

{% info %}
We recommend using the Alien standalone with **Cloudify 3.3.1** on **OpenStack**.
{% endinfo %}

##2. Start and configure Alien 4 Cloud :

Assuming you have downloaded in the prerequisite, extract the archive and execute the following commands in your shell :

{% highlight sh %}
cd alien4cloud
./alien4cloud.sh
{% endhighlight %}

To check that Alien4Cloud is working, open it in your browser (default port is 8088 on the machine hosting A4C), you should see the authentication splash screen.

##3. Import components in Alien 4 Cloud:

{% info %}
Regardless the used provider, read the following section to know how to import your
components archive : [import components](#/documentation/1.1.0/user_guide/components_management.html)
{% endinfo %}

### Required types for Wordpress

The Wordpress topology is using custom types, we have to upload them first.
Find those types on github here : [samples repository](https://github.com/alien4cloud/samples){:target="_blank"}

* **apache** : the webserver [here](https://github.com/alien4cloud/samples/tree/master/apache){:target="_blank"}
* **php** : the php interperter [here](https://github.com/alien4cloud/samples/tree/master/php){:target="_blank"}
* **mysql** : the database required by Wordpress [here](https://github.com/alien4cloud/samples/tree/master/mysql){:target="_blank"}
* **wordpress** : the blog component [here](https://github.com/alien4cloud/samples/tree/master/wordpress){:target="_blank"}

Zip the content of each folder and upload each zipped file in this order.

### Wordpress topology

In order to have an full application ready to deploy through Alien 4 Cloud, just download the yaml description
of the topology here : [Wordpress topology](https://github.com/alien4cloud/samples/blob/master/topology-wordpress/wordpress-template.yml){:target="_blank"}.

When you have this file, zip it, then you will be able to import it into Alien 4 Cloud as
an [topology template](#/documentation/1.1.0/user_guide/topology_management.html).

{% info %}
Find detailed informations about the wordpress topology [here](#/documentation/1.1.0/devops_guide/lamp_stack_tutorial/lamp_stack_application.html).
{% endinfo %}

##4. Create an Wordpress application:

Now we have the Wordpress template ready to use, we can create an application based on it. To do this, go to the `Application` section, click on the `New application` button and select the **wordpress-template** in the topology template dropdown.

The application creation should redirect you on the `Application > Informations` page.
To see your application topology, go to the `Application > Topology` page, you will see the following screen.

##5. Install and configure provider plugin:

To try Alien 4 Cloud with provider plugin *Cloudify* **3.x** you will need a cloud ready to use with your credentials.
If not, we advice you to use [trystack](http://trystack.org/){:target="_blank"}, a personal an free to use OpenStack.

To configure and start Cloudify 3 driver, please refer to those following sections : [Cloudify 3 plugin](#/documentation/1.1.0/orchestrators/cloudify3_driver/install_config.html)

In our tutorial, let's call the configured orchestrator `My_orchestrator` and this unique location `My_location`.

##6. Setup and deploy your application:

To deploy this new application, go on `Applications > Deployments` submenu and :

* Select your location
* Select the template who matches with your computers
* Select the `os_arch` of your computes
* And click on the `Deploy` button
