TOSCA normative lifecycle is automatically generated by the TOSCA container based on the normative node and relationship types.

{% note %}
Note that the TOSCA specification on lifecycle is still being written so this may be subject to changes before v1 release.
{% endnote %}

Lifecycle is based on the normative node interface (tosca.interfaces.node.lifecycle.Standard) and relationship interface (tosca.interfaces.relationship.Configure).

## Node Lifecycle generation

1. wait for all node that is a target of a _DependsOn_ relationship to reach the _started_ state (current node being source of the relationship).
2. call the node's _create_ operation
4. call the relationships _pre_configure_source_ (if the node is the relationship source) or _pre_configure_target_ (if the node is the relationship target)
5. call the node's _configure_ operation
6. call the relationships _post_configure_source_ (if the node is the relationship source) or _post_configure_target_ (if the node is the relationship target)
7. call the node's _start_ operation
8. call the relationships _add_target_ (on the nodes sources) and _add_source_ (on the nodes targets) operations.
