        <h1 style="margin-top: 0px;">TOSCA concepts</h1>
        <p>TOSCA specification allows users to specify a cloud application’s topology by defining a set of nodes that are connected to other using relationships.</p>

<p>The goal of the TOSCA specification is to focus on a good meta-definition of cloud applications and their components and focus on the following goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reusability of components</li>
  <li>Interoperability of TOSCA archive through the different TOSCA containers</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to manage reusability of components and defined recipes, TOSCA allows definition of NodeTypes that specify the available components and eventually their implementation (for example a Java NodeType and the script implementation to install it on a virtual server). The defined NodeTypes can then be reused when a developer or application architect want to define the topology of a cloud application.</p>

<h1 id="tosca-simple-profile-in-yaml">TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML</h1>

<p>TOSCA Simple profile in YAML allows definition of TOSCA elements in a YAML format rather than XML. The YAML format is simpler to write and offers some shorter ways to defined a TOSCA definition.</p>

<div class="note warning">
<p><em>Note: TOSCA Simple profile is a working draft and is not released yet to public. Current Alien 4 Cloud version is using a Alien 4 Cloud’s specific DSL that is really close to the latest TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML TC work. This may be subject to some updates in the future.</em></p>
</div>

<h1 id="tosca-in-alien-4-cloud">TOSCA in Alien 4 Cloud</h1>

<p>In Alien 4 Cloud, TOSCA can be used to define both Types (catalog elements) and Applications topologies (Templates). Alien 4 Cloud tools like the topology editor allows you to create Application topologies that can be exported to Tosca Templates.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Alien 4 Cloud support a slightly modified version of TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML in order to add features that are specific to Alien 4 Cloud context. However we are able to load pure TOSCA compliant templates and also export topologies as pure TOSCA templates.</p>
</div>

<div class="note warning">
<p>Export feature will be available in the next release.</p>
