Let us introduce you to Alien 4 Cloud concepts. Alien 4 Cloud is an application that allows people in the enterprise to collaborate in order to provide self-service deployment of complex applications, taking in account different levels of expertise through a role-based portal.
 
Alien 4 Cloud aims at providing self-service not only for users but also for development teams, which want to build and deploy complex applications and leverage cloud resources to setup their environments in minutes.
 
In order to provide an enterprise self-service portal, Alien 4 Cloud leverages the following concepts:
 
* __Location__: Deployment target (cloud or set of physical machines)
* __Components__: Software components to deploy
* __Topologies__ (or blueprints): Description of multiple software components assembled together (to build an application)
* __Applications__: Actual applications to deploy with _environments_ and _versions_ each of them being associated with a topology
* __TOSCA__: An emerging standard to describe service components and their relationships.
 
On top of these notions, Alien 4 Cloud provides a comprehensive set of __roles__ that can be mapped in flexible manners to the people and structure of an enterprise IT department.
