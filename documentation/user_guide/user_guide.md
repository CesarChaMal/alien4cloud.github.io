## Welcome to Alien's user guide!

This section will explain you how to use Alien 4 Cloud it is organized based on the [concepts](#/documentation/concepts/concepts.html) but you can find below links to sections you may be interested in based on the [roles](#/documentation/concepts/roles.html) you have.

* As a __Platform admin__ you probably should read first the [Administration Guide](#/documentation/admin_guide/index.html) in order to install and setup Alien 4 Cloud. Once done you will be interested in [Plugin management](#/documentation/user_guide/plugin_management.html) as well a [Cloud management](#/documentation/user_guide/cloud_management.html).
* As a __Dev-Ops__ we suggest you to read the [Components management](#/documentation/user_guide/components/components_catalog.html) section and to get familiar with [TOSCA reference](#/documentation/devops_guide/tosca_concepts.html) you can also look at our [LAMP Stack Tutorial](#/documentation/devops_guide/lamp_stack_tutorial/lamp_stack.html) that provides a good kickoff on building components with TOSCA.
