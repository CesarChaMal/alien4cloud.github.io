This section details configuration of supported orchestrators in alien 4 cloud.

We currently officially support Cloudify 3 and are working with Cloudsoft on the support of Apache Brooklyn.

In 1.3.0, we added experimental support of Marathon, a meta-framework for Mesos which enables scheduling and orchestration of Docker containers.

If you are looking for information on how to contribute or integrate other orchestrators or deployment technologies please check out our contribute section.
