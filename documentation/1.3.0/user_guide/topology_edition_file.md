# Upload new file

In this view you can upload or remove a file to your topology archive. This file can be, for example, a new script for your components or a new artifact.
To select your file click on ![upload button](../../images/1.3.0/user_guide/upload-file-menu-upload-button.png){: .inline} and then, click on ![add button](../../images/1.3.0/user_guide/upload-file-menu-add-button.png){: .inline} to add it to your topology archive. You can also create a file or a new repository but it cannot be empty (for example, write `toto/titi` to create a new repository 'toto' with a new file 'titi').
