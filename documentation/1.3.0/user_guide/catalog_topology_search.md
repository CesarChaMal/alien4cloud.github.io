# Topology list

Once you have created / uploaded an archive that contains a topology you should be able to see it in the template list :

![Topology template list](../../images/user_guide/user_guide_topology_template_list.png)

From now you can use any template when [creating a new application](#/documentation/1.3.0/user_guide/application_management.html). But before that, you might want to  [edit the topology](#/documentation/1.3.0/user_guide/topology_edition.html).
