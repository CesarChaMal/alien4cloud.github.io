Alien4Cloud is a project started by FastConnect in order to help enterprise adopting the cloud.

ALIEN leverages [OASIS TOSCA](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tosca) standard as we believe that moving an enterprise to the cloud should be done free of any vendor lock-in. Indeed cloud is a structural change for IT and getting lock to a vendor means a huge impact on the enterprise flexibility.

For the same reasons we decided to provide ALIEN with a full-backend-featured community edition.

ALIEN leverage some other existing opensources projects that help orchestrating cloud applications such as GigaSpaces Cloudify 2 and soon 3.
