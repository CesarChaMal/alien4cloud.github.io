# Alien 4 Cloud fixed issues

* ALIEN-283: Download button in the UI now points to the latest version.
* ALIEN-330: When updating group informations and the update fails (e-mail not correct for example) the ui was keeping the updated value. The old version (that is the one on server) is now reverted in the UI for more consistency.
* ALIEN-343: Fixed topology template name unicity
