# Alien 4 Cloud fixed issues

* CALM-283: Download button in the UI now points to the latest version.
* CALM-330: When updating group informations and the update fails (e-mail not correct for example) the ui was keeping the updated value. The old version (that is the one on server) is now reverted in the UI for more consistency.
* CALM-343: Fixed topology template name unicity

* CALM-372: Fixed a bug creating issues with CSAR dependencies management when uploading an archive.
* CALM-374: Fixed an issue with plugins re-loading on windows. This is related to Classloader management in JVM.
