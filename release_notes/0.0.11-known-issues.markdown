This sections details ALIEN known issues and limitations that will be fixed in next releases.

## Known issues

### ALIEN 4 Cloud

* Mixing nodes from different versions of a single archive in a topology may cause issues when deploying the topology. Moreover removing nodes from a version doesn't prevent them to be used rather than the other version specified.

### Cloudify 2 PaaS Provider

* Classpath is not managed correctly executing groovy scripts (node folder is not added to the classpath, only the service root folder is).
* Issue with generated groovy scripts on windows.

## Limitations and feature requests

### ALIEN 4 Cloud

* Generated output for properties and endpoints to users doesn't take in account the full hierarchy (no urls are generated for example)

### Cloudify 2 PaaS Provider

* Properties are accessed through the generation of a properties files rather than from operation parameters. This is less flexible and create a strong binding from the recipe implementation and the implementation of the TOSCA container.
