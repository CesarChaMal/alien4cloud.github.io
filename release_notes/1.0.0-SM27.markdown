  | Type        | Id         | Description |
  |:------------|:-----------|:------------|
    |  <i class="fa fa-plus text-success"></i> | ALIEN-863 | Admin can now stop a cloud even if the cloud is used by some applications. /  |
    |  <i class="fa fa-plus text-success"></i> | ALIEN-928 | Scalability being now defined from the Scalable capability, it is possible to configure them as input properties so the user can configure them before deployment. /  |
    |  <i class="fa fa-plus text-success"></i> | ALIEN-931 | When a user delete a CSAR from the repository and the CSAR is used by other CSARs or Topologies we now display an error message that list the usages. /  |
      |  <i class="fa fa-level-up text-primary"></i> | ALIEN-739 | We now use a proper logger in the generated cloudify recipe with many logs in debug level and provide it to users also. /  |
    |  <i class="fa fa-level-up text-primary"></i> | ALIEN-878 | We now leverage the Scalable capability of compute to setup scalability for compute nodes. It is now possible to defined a scalable property in the YAML and it will be correctly managed by a4c. /  |
    |  <i class="fa fa-level-up text-primary"></i> | ALIEN-968 | Users can now reset the values of properties or artifacts to their default. /  |
    |  <i class="fa fa-level-up text-primary"></i> | ALIEN-983 | Login and password inputs now have placeholders. /  |
    |  <i class="fa fa-level-up text-primary"></i> | ALIEN-986 | Improve the handling of get_operation_outputs so that attributes configured with a get_operation_output can be accessed by operations of a topology and not only used as topology outputs. /  |
    |  <i class="fa fa-level-up text-primary"></i> | ALIEN-1029 | Improve the packaging of the Events processing unit so the login/password infos are not being copied on every nodes but only the management node. /  |
      |  <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle text-warning">  <i class="fa fa-bug text-danger"></i> | ALIEN-851 | Fixed an issue in the REST API create environment operation that had a security leak (application id was asked both in path and request can could be different allowing users to perform operations on applications on which they had no rights). /  |
    |  <i class="fa fa-bug text-danger"></i> | ALIEN-958 | It is now possible to use again _ in node names. Known limitation: Cloudify 2 driver will automatically rename the nodes but won't support multiple nodes with similar patterns (toto-1 or toto_1 are considered as same node by the driver). /  |
    |  <i class="fa fa-bug text-danger"></i> | ALIEN-1003 | It is now possible to reset mandatory properties to their default (or blank) even if it has been set previously (thanks to the reset to default feature). /  |
    |  <i class="fa fa-bug text-danger"></i> | ALIEN-1016 | Fixed an issue introduced in SM26 with the handling of get_operation_output causing null pointer exception when no echo was returned by an operation. /  |
