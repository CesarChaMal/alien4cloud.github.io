This sections details ALIEN known issues and limitations that will be fixed in next releases.

## Known issues

* Mixing nodes from different versions of a single archive in a topology may cause issues when deploying the topology. Moreover removing nodes from a version doesn't prevent them to be used rather than the other version specified.
* Cloudify driver: doesn't manage classpath correctly executing groovy scripts (node folder is not added to the classpath, only the service root folder is).
* Cloudify driver: Issue with generated groovy scripts on windows.

## Limitations and feature requests

* Generated output for properties and endpoints to users doesn't take in account the full hierarchy (no urls are generated for example)
