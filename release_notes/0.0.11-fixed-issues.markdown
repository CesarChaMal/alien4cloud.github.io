* CALM-251: Fix an issue on capabilities and requirements bounds management when a node template is renamed or removed.
* CALM-232: Fix a bug in the validation of relationships target upper bound (was actually checking from the requirement's bound instead).
* CALM-244: When a relationship is added to a topology, a dependency on the CSAR that contains the relationship is now added. This prevented to generate workflows in some situations.

* CALM-284: The runtime view display the deployed topology and not the current application topology fixing issues in event and state rendering.
