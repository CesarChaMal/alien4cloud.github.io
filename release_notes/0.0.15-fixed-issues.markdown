# Alien 4 Cloud fixed issues

* ALIEN-432: Fixed an issue that prevented the ability to auto-upload some default components when Alien starts for the first time. Note that the feature is still disabled for now however.
* ALIEN-488: Fixed an issue that caused the runtime view button in application tab not being updated on deployment.
* ALIEN-496: Fixed a bug that prevented usage of a single cloudify manager from multiple Alien instances (useful for testing).


# Cloudify 2 PaaS Provider fixed issues

* ALIEN-489: Fix an issue in the storage lifecycle: Storage is now created, attached, mounted and formatted just after the compute is created but before any other step.
* ALIEN-496: Fixed a bug that prevented usage of a single cloudify manager from multiple Alien instances (useful for testing).


# Tosca Components fixed issues
