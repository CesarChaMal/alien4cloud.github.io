At the heart of alien 4 cloud is the TOSCA catalog. The catalog provides:
* indexes of TOSCA types and topology templates to easily browse and find them and use them in the composer
* repository to download or browse content of archives
* ACL features to control who can access the archives

# Alien 4 Cloud indexes

Alien 4 cloud indexing is managed by elasticsearch. It allows faceted search (through aggregations) and other features.

# The archive repository
