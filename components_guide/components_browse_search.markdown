Alien4Cloud  provides ways to browse the uploaded components, with a search engine allowing filters.

{% info %}Users with role **COMPONENT_MANAGER** can browse and search for components.{% endinfo %}

## How to make a simple search

On the left of the components list page, there is a search pannel (see figure above: **A**).<br>
For a  simple search, just type the searched text in the seach field and press the magnifier next to it (or press the **Enter** keybord instead). The result of your research will be displayed on the center pannel (see figure above: **B**).

## How to make a filtered search

You might wish to filter your search or results, for there are too many components corresponding to the simple search.
Still on the left search pannel, you can select one or more filters (facets). You can also remove them if they do not fit you.

{% info %}
Note that when more than one filter are selected, Alien4Cloud applies an AND policy.
{% endinfo %}

## Component overview

After the search, you can have an overview of the component. Just move the mouse on one component and you will have the right pannel display its summary:(see figure above: **C**).
