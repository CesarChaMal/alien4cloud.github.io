ALIEN is a project started by FastConnect in order to help enterprise adopting the cloud.

ALIEN leverage OASIS TOSCA standard as we believe that moving an enterprise to the cloud should not be done free of any vendor locking. Indeed cloud is a structural change for IT and getting lock to a vendor means a huge impact on the enterprise flexibility.

For the same reasons we decided to provide ALIEN with a full-backend-featured community edition.

ALIEN leverage some other existing opensources projects that help orchestrating cloud applications such as GigaSpaces Cloudify.
